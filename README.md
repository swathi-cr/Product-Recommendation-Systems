Domain - E-commerce
Context - Everyday a million products are being recommended to users based on
popularity and other metrics on e-commerce websites. The most popular e-commerce
website boosts average order value by 50%, increases revenues by 300%, and
improves conversion. In addition to being a powerful tool for increasing revenues,
product recommendations are so essential that customers now expect to see similar
features on all other eCommerce sites.
Data Description -
Data columns- First three columns are userId, productId, and ratings and the fourth
column is timestamp. You can discard the timestamp column as in this case you may
not need to use it.
Source - Amazon Reviews data (http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) The
repository has several datasets. For this case study, we are using the Electronics
dataset.
